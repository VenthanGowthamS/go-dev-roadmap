The house is the WaitGroup instance stored at a single memory address.

Inside the house, thereâ€™s one counter (initially 4, because 4 goroutines are added).

Each goroutine shares this same house and accesses the same counter.

When a goroutine finishes, it calls Done(), which reduces the counter by 1.

The counter moves like this:
Counter: 4 --> 3 --> 2 --> 1 --> 0
When the counter reaches 0, the WaitGroup knows all goroutines are done, so wg.Wait() unblocks.
