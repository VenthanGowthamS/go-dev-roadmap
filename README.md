- HTTP Server
- Recursive Fibonacci
- Structs and Pointers
- More coming soon...

## 🛠 How to Set Up and Run

### 1. Install Go

If you haven’t already, download and install Go from:  
https://go.dev/dl/

### 2. Initialize a Go module (only once per project)

Inside the `hello-world` folder, run:

```
bash
go mod init hello-world

```

#### 3. Run any Go program
```
go run main.go

go run .

Let me know if you’d like me to customize this further — for example, adding links to specific files or breaking down your learning timeline.
