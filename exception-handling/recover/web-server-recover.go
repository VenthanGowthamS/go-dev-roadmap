/*
Flow Explanation for defer, panic, and recover:

1. The main function runs ‚Äî this is the program's entry point.

2. The main function calls safeHandler() (or another function where panic may occur).

3. Inside safeHandler, a deferred anonymous function is registered:

   defer func() {
       if r := recover(); r != nil {
           fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
       }
   }()

   - This deferred function is registered immediately but will only run when safeHandler returns ‚Äî either normally or due to a panic.

4. Code runs normally until a panic occurs.

5. When panic happens:

   - Go starts unwinding the call stack, cleaning up from the most recent function call backwards.

   - During unwinding, Go executes any defer blocks in last-in-first-out order.

6. The deferred recovery function runs during this unwinding:

   - recover() captures the panic value.

   - If a panic was present (r != nil), it prints the recovery message.

7. Because recover() handled the panic, the program does NOT crash and continues gracefully.
