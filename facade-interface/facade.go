/*
This is a simplified simulation of how a computer boots up:

CPU freezes current state

Memory loads the boot instructions

CPU jumps to a memory location

CPU starts executing instructions

Hard Drive provides the data (e.g., boot sector)

The goal here is not to build a real OS,
but to illustrate how complex subsystems (CPU, Memory, Hard Drive) can be controlled through a simplified interface
â€” the Facade.*/
